This directory includes:

* `node.py`: which
  * defines a node class. 
    * contains a name, list of children, and a count that's initially zero
    * implements a `show(graph)` method recursively prints the nodes within graph  
    *implenets a toGraph and toDictionary functions to convert from dictionary to graph
    and viceversa 
  * An `increment(graph)` method that increments the counts of all nodes within graph. 
* `localDemo.py`: which creates a dag of nodes, which it prints, increments, and prints again.

*`Client and Server`: Which is the assigment, the client will send a graph (that will be a dictionary)
In Json format, then the server will recreate the graph based in the dictionary received  apply 
the increment function, make it dictionary again and resend it, finally the client converts from dictionary to 
graph again and prints the result.

*`Json request file:`For the manually generated file i got 

{
    "name": "root",
        "val":0
            "children":{
              "name": "leaf1",
                "val":0,
                  "children":[]
              "name": "leaf1",
                "val":0,
                  "children":[]
              "name": "leaf2",
                "val":0,
                  "children":[]              
            }
}

And for the one generated by my client i got:

{u'children': [{u'children': [], u'val': 1, u'name': u'leaf1'}, {u'children': [], u'val': 1, u'name': u'leaf1'}, {u'children': [], u'val': 1, u'name': u'leaf2'}], u'val': 1, u'name': u'root'}


*`Collaborations:` For this lab i worked with Cynthia Valencia, in the approach that would be 
better for this assigment, help with debbuging and helping each other to better understand the 
assigment.
